Part of the code is developed based on modification or reusing the source code of the hmmlearn package https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn.

The source code base1.py is developed based on modification of the file base.py from the hmmlearn package. The source code utils.py and _hmmc.c are reused from the hmmlearn package. Some functions in phylo_hmgp.py are used with modifications from the functions in the file hmm.py from the hmmlearn package. 

A statement on reusing the source code of the hmmlearn package, according to the copyrigh holders of hmmlearn, is available in the filefolder statement_hmmlearn. A list of the authors of the hmmlearn package, as complementary to the statement, is also included.
